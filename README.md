## 📄 Overview

The **ID Card Validation Check** project uses computer vision techniques to compare ID cards and determine their authenticity. Leveraging OpenCV and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), this notebook detects whether two images of ID cards are visually similar — useful for ID verification, forgery detection, and automation of identity checks.

## 🔍 Features

- Image pre-processing using OpenCV
- Calculation of SSIM to compare ID cards
- Automatic highlighting of differing regions
- Simple visual output to help verify authenticity
- Customizable for batch validation scenarios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** 3.8+
- **OpenCV** for image manipulation
- **scikit-image** for SSIM comparison
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive development

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/id-card-validation-check.git
   cd id-card-validation-check

## 📷 Example Use

1. Load two ID card images
2. Use the SSIM comparison block
3. View the result and visual differences
4. The notebook highlights areas of dissimilarity to aid manual review.

## ✅ Future Improvements

1. Integrate OCR for text comparison
2. Support batch processing of IDs
2. Add web-based user interface
